Carrie is an American epistolary novel and author Stephen King's first published novel, released on April 5, 1974, with an approximate first print run of 30,000 copies. Set in the then-future year of 1979, it revolves around the eponymous Carrietta N. White a misfit and bullied high school girl who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who torment her, while in the process causing one of the worst local disasters in American history. Stephen has commented that he finds the work to be "Raw" and "With a surprising power to hurt and horrify". It is one of the most frequently banned books in United States schools. Much of the book is written in an epistolary structure, using newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books to tell how Carrie destroyed the fictional town of Chamberlain, Maine while exacting revenge on her sadistic classmates. Several adaptations of Carrie have been released, including a 1976 film, a 1988, 2012, 2015 Broadway musical, a 1999 film sequel, a 2002 television film, and a 2013 film remake.
