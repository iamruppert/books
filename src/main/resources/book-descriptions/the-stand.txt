The novel is a post-apocalyptic horror/fantasy story that re-works the scenario of King's earlier short story, "Night Surf." A longer edition of the novel was later released in May 1990; King restored some text originally cut for brevity, added and revised sections, changed the timeframe of the story from 1980 to 1990, and updated several pop culture references accordingly to the time. Incidentally in 1980, when the first paperback publication of The Stand was released by Signet, the date of the story was moved from 1980 to 1985. It stayed 1985 until the release of the longer edition in 1989. The novel has been translated into at least a dozen languages.
